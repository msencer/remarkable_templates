# My reMarkable 2 templates

The templates are built using [NoTeTo](https://noteto.needleinthehay.de/) template builder. If you'd like to change, use the *Load from JSON* option on the tool, select the template you'd like to change from ```templates/noTeToConfigs/<template_name>.json```, make your changes on the GUI and don't forget to save the JSON.

## Daily journal
![](templates/pngs/journal.png)

I keep daily journal every morning. I start with stating 3 gratitudes and the remaining is free-form writing. At the end I assess how I feel.

## Daily planner
![](templates/pngs/daily_planner.png)

I use this template to review my daily priorities and agenda a day before. At the end of the day, I fill in the bottom part with TIL, reflections. I compare the stars in this template with the hearts in *Daily Journal* to see if there is a discrepancy. The section with the icons are representing the behaviors that I'd like to incorporate in my life:

* Each **pomodoro** icon represents a [pomodoro](https://todoist.com/productivity-methods/pomodoro-technique) session (25mins work/5mins break)
* I have a [**FOCI**](https://fociai.com/) device which logs my emoitions throughout the day. It also provides the amount of time that I spend in focus daily. Every clock icon represents 30mins of focus time.
* Each **water droplet** represents 500ml of water
* Each **workout** and **meditation** icon represents 30mins


## Weekly planner

## Good Time Journal
![](templates/pngs/gt_journal.png)

I got the inspiration from the book called ["Designing Your Life"](https://designingyour.life/the-book/). I set 8 random alarms from 10:00 to 21:30 to log the activity that I am doing. I would like to do this for 3 weeks and have a good understanding of which activities energizes me and which does not etc.

## How to install the templates on your reMarkable

Please follow [this guide](https://philerb.com/2021/12/26/remarkable-tablet-ssh/) to setup the SSH access to your device. The install script uses the same config. Once you are done with the config test:

```

```

For the json merge operation, we'd need [jq](https://github.com/stedolan/jq) in the PATH.

```
$ brew install jq
...
$ which jq
/opt/homebrew/bin/jq
```

If the connection is successful & jq is in the path, please run the installation.
